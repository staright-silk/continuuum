        <p><strong>PRE - 1917</strong></p>
        <p>Palestine exists as a lived geography. Muslims, Christians, Jews live across cities and villages. Land ownership documented locally, communally, generationally. A place does not need permission to exist.</p>

        <h3>Imperial Promise</h3>
        <p>The British Empire issues a declaration. A homeland is promised to Zionist leadership. The indigenous Palestinian majority is not consulted. Colonialism begins with a sentence. Britain | World War I | Mandate governance</p>

        <p>British rule facilitates demographic engineering. Armed Zionist militias form and train. Palestinian revolts suppressed with collective punishment. Villages fined. Homes demolished. Leaders exiled. Resistance criminalized before dispossession is complete.</p>

        <p>The land is divided by international vote. The majority population loses most of the territory. Implementation backed by force, not agreement. A vote cannot overwrite reality.</p>
