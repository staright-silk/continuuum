# Figma-to-HTML: Timeline Rebuild

This repository contains a minimal static scaffold recreating the Figma timeline site.

Quick start

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or serve via a static server).

2. Export images from the Figma source and place them in the `assets/` folder.

3. Edit or add more `<section class="slide">` blocks in `index.html` to match the full timeline content.

Next steps

- Refine typography and spacing to match the Figma file precisely.
- Export and add images/icons to `assets/` and reference them in the markup.
- Improve accessibility and add nicer transitions/animations.
